		<h4>Sub Title/description</h4>
		<p>CrisisCorps was founded in 2016 in response to the tragic shootings that occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. Our goal is to help cities mobilize response teams and volunteers in quicker, more efficient ways by being prepared before disaster strikes.</p> 
		<p>When tragedy strikes, whatever the cause, we all feel the impact when our city, our homes, have been attacked. Police, paramedics, firefighters all have their roles to play, and it the past, the average citizen was on the sidelines looking for any opportunity to support.</p>
		<p>CrisisCorps gives all of us a chance to step up and step in! When your friends and neighbors are in need, it is a way we can all band together to support our city, no matter your skill level or experience. Are you skilled at first aid? Are you good with a hammer and nails? Can you pass out water bottles and snacks? Can you be shoulder to cry on? This is where your city needs you!</p>
